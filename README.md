## Deutsche Biographie Lookup for Obisidan

Search and insert biographical data from deutsche-biographie.de.

**Note:** Currently in developement.

## Features

This plugin will let you search for historical biographical data and let you generate a bio-page in markdown, intended for use with **Obsidian-MD**.

Right now, it is only planned to include deusche-biographie.de as a provider of data, but perhaps there will be more added – feel free to suggest them.

## Usage

Install the plugin by copying it into your plugins folder in your vault and activate it, or install it via the plugin-browser (not yet available).

1. Use the command Historical Query to open up the search modal
2. Enter your search string: Ideally stick to Lastname, Firstname – but anything goes.
3. The weighted search results are displayed from oldest to youngest person.
4. If your search term is very broad (e.g. Johann or Maria), then the search results will take a bit to process. Dont worry.
5. Select your entry and hit enter or click on it, and it will be saved as a markdown file.
